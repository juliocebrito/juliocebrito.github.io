# juliocebrito.github.io

Personal website for Julio Brito. This repository contains the source code for my
static site served through GitHub Pages.

## Deploying

1. Clone the repository and make your changes.
2. Push to the `master` branch (or `main` depending on your fork). GitHub Pages
   will automatically rebuild and publish the site.
3. The site is available at <https://juliocebrito.github.io> and also at
   <https://juliocebrito.com> thanks to the `CNAME` file.

To preview the site locally just open `index.html` in your browser. No additional
build steps are required.

## Requirements

A modern web browser is all you need to view or develop the site. The design
uses the "Source Code Pro" font served via Google Fonts, so an internet
connection is required to load it when viewing locally.
